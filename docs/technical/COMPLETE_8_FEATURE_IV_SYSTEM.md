# Complete 8-Feature Delta/Implied Volatility System

## üéØ **Overview**

You now have the complete set of 8 delta/implied volatility features! The options pricing system has been updated to use all 8 features for more accurate and robust options pricing.

## üìä **Complete 8-Feature Set**

### **Core 30D ATM Features (2):**
- `{TICKER}_CALL_IMP_VOL_30D` - 30-day ATM call implied volatility
- `{TICKER}_PUT_IMP_VOL_30D` - 30-day ATM put implied volatility

### **1M Delta Smile Features (6):**
- `{TICKER}_1M_CALL_IMP_VOL_10DELTA_DFLT` - 1M call 10-delta IV ‚úÖ **NEWLY AVAILABLE**
- `{TICKER}_1M_CALL_IMP_VOL_25DELTA_DFLT` - 1M call 25-delta IV
- `{TICKER}_1M_CALL_IMP_VOL_40DELTA_DFLT` - 1M call 40-delta IV
- `{TICKER}_1M_PUT_IMP_VOL_40DELTA_DFLT` - 1M put 40-delta IV
- `{TICKER}_1M_PUT_IMP_VOL_25DELTA_DFLT` - 1M put 25-delta IV ‚úÖ **NEWLY AVAILABLE**
- `{TICKER}_1M_PUT_IMP_VOL_10DELTA_DFLT` - 1M put 10-delta IV

## üîß **What Changed**

### **1. Stricter Column Requirements**
- **Before**: Required only 30D ATM + at least 2 delta smile columns per side
- **Now**: Requires ALL 8 features (30D ATM + all 6 delta smile columns)

### **2. Better Interpolation**
- **Before**: Worked with whatever delta columns were available (minimum 2)
- **Now**: Uses all 3 delta points for each side (10D, 25D, 40D) for better interpolation

### **3. More Robust Pricing**
- **Before**: Had to work around missing features with fallbacks
- **Now**: Uses complete smile curve for accurate delta-targeted pricing

## üéõÔ∏è **How It Works**

### **IV Anchor System:**
1. **30D ATM**: Used as the base anchor for term structure
2. **1M Smile**: Used for delta-specific pricing and strike determination
3. **Power Law Mapping**: Maps 30D anchor to target tenor using realized vol blend

### **Delta Targeting:**
- **Calls**: 10D, 25D, 40D deltas available
- **Puts**: -40D, -25D, -10D deltas available
- **Interpolation**: Linear interpolation between all 3 points for any target delta

### **Strike Solving:**
- Uses complete smile curve to solve for exact delta targets
- Falls back to ATM if strike solving fails
- More accurate than the previous 2-point system

## üöÄ **Benefits**

### **1. More Accurate Pricing**
- Complete smile curve gives better delta interpolation
- More precise strike determination for target deltas
- Better handling of smile skew and term structure

### **2. Better Risk Management**
- More accurate delta hedging
- Better gamma and vega estimates
- More realistic option pricing for different moneyness levels

### **3. Robust Fallbacks**
- Still falls back to 3M IV if new features aren't available
- Graceful degradation if any individual feature is missing
- Maintains backward compatibility

## üîç **Configuration**

The system uses these settings in your config:

```python
# In alpha_discovery/config.py
settings.options.iv_anchor = "1M"  # Use 1M smile as anchor
settings.options.delta_bucket = "AUTO_BY_DIRECTION"  # Auto-select delta
settings.options.strict_new_iv = True  # Require all 8 features
```

### **Available Delta Buckets:**
- `AUTO_BY_DIRECTION` - Auto-selects 40D for calls, -40D for puts
- `CALL_10D`, `CALL_25D`, `CALL_40D` - Specific call deltas
- `PUT_10D`, `PUT_25D`, `PUT_40D` - Specific put deltas
- `ATM` - Traditional ATM pricing

## üìà **Expected Improvements**

### **1. Better Delta Targeting**
- More accurate strike selection for target deltas
- Better handling of extreme deltas (10D, 40D)
- More realistic option pricing across moneyness

### **2. Improved Smile Interpolation**
- 3-point interpolation instead of 2-point
- Better handling of smile skew
- More accurate pricing for intermediate deltas

### **3. Enhanced Risk Metrics**
- More accurate delta, gamma, vega calculations
- Better risk-adjusted returns
- More realistic option P&L attribution

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the system** with your new data
2. **Monitor pricing accuracy** compared to previous runs
3. **Check delta targeting** is working correctly
4. **Verify fallbacks** still work if any features are missing

The system is now ready to use the complete 8-feature set for more accurate and robust options pricing! üöÄ
